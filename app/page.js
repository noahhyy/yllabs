          After careful consideration, <strong>Botara has been discontinued</strong> for now.
        </p>

        <p>
          This decision was not easy, but I need to focus on my <strong>mental health</strong> 
          and take a step back from development.
        </p>

        <p>
          Thank you to everyone who supported Botara and believed in the project. 
          Your support truly meant everything.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is not necessarily permanent — it’s a pause until I am ready to return stronger.
